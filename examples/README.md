# Examples Directory

This directory is reserved for reference implementation examples.

## Purpose

Contains example code files that demonstrate:
- Complete backend implementation patterns
- Complete frontend component implementations
- Code templates for new features

## Note

These are optional reference files for developers who want to see complete examples of how the system was implemented.

When adding new features, refer to:
1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - For step-by-step implementation guide
2. **Existing code** in backend/src/ and frontend/src/ - For current patterns
3. This directory (when populated) - For reference examples
